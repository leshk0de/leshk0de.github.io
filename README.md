# Welcome to my github page

Welcome to my digital domain! I specialize in the security field, my expertise encompasses a variety of areas, including penetration testing, blue team operations, and general security automation, with a particular focus on cloud technologies and network security. Outside of my professional life, I have a passion for gaming, which sharpens my strategic thinking, hiking for its serenity, and soccer for its blend of teamwork and competitiveness. 

I use this space to consolidate personal projects as I play with various technologies and learn along the way.
